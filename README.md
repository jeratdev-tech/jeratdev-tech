# 👋 Hi there, I’m Stephen James (a.k.a codebyjerat)

- 👀 I’m interested in web development, front-end technologies, and building clean, user-friendly UIs.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning **React** and diving deeper into **JavaScript**.
- 💼 I've built projects like an **eCommerce app (SwiftMall)** and a **School Management System**.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source front-end projects and anything JavaScript/React-related.
